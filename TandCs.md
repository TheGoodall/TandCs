# Payment Terms:

Invoiced clients will need to clear the outstanding fee within 30 days or the invoice due date (whichever is sooner).
Late payments will incur daily late payment penalties of 5% of the outstanding sum for a maximum of 31 days.
After 31 days past the invoice due date (61st day overall), if it remains unpaid and outstanding beyond this time, proceedings to make a court claim against the client will be made and the client will be notified of this via email.

# Travel Expenses:

A charge of Â£0.45 per mile will be added to invoices to cover the costs of car travel incurred by the contractor in the performance of the Services.
This rate applies to all motor travel related to the provision of the Services, irrespective of the type of vehicle used or the time of day or night at which the travel occurs.

# Parking:

At locations where the contractor is required to provide Services, free parking must be made available for the duration of the Service provision.
In the event that free parking is not available or provided, any associated costs incurred by the contractor for parking his/her vehicle will be added to the Client's invoice.
This includes any parking charges, fines, or penalties related to parking the vehicle, as these are considered a necessary cost of providing the Services.
The Client is responsible for ensuring proper provision for parking at the Service location or bearing any additional costs thereof.

# Confidentiality:

Both parties agree to keep confidential any information obtained about the other during the agreement, unless necessary for the provision or receipt of Services or expressly allowed by the other party.

# Liability Limitations:

The contractor's total liability for any loss or damage caused by its services or its failure to perform services will not exceed the amount of fees paid by the Client.

# Force Majeure:

Neither party will be liable for any failure to fulfill its obligations caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control.
These circumstances may include but are not limited to natural disasters, war, civil disturbance, or government actions.

# Cancellation Policy:

If the Client wishes to cancel the Services, they must provide the contractor with at least 14 days written notice.
In case of cancellation, any costs incurred or commitments entered into by the contractor up to the point of cancellation will be invoiced to the Client.
If the cancellation notice is received less than 14 days before the scheduled event or service date, the Client will be responsible for paying the full agreed-upon fee unless otherwise agreed upon in writing between the Client and contractor.
Any outstanding payments for services rendered up to the point of cancellation will be due immediately upon receipt of invoice.

# Dispute Resolution:
 
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall first be attempted to be resolved through mutual discussions.
If the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner, it will be referred to mediation or arbitration in accordance with the laws of the governing jurisdiction.

# Independent Contractor:

The contractor is an independent contractor, not an employee of the Client.
The contractor retains control over the means and methods of the Services and is responsible for their own business expenses and taxes.

# Entire Agreement:

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes all prior discussions or agreements.
Any changes to this Agreement must be agreed to in writing by both parties.

# Severability:

If any section, clause, provision or sentence of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining parts of this Agreement.
If any part of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement will continue in effect as if such portion had not been included, and the parties agree to replace the unenforceable part with an enforceable clause that as closely as possible reflects the original intent of the parties.

# Hired Equipment:

The contractor may provide equipment on a rental basis for the duration of the Services.
The Client agrees to take full responsibility for the care, maintenance, and safekeeping of the hired equipment during the rental period.
The Client shall return all hired equipment in the same condition as received, normal wear and tear excepted, by the agreed-upon deadline following the completion or cancellation of the Services.
In the event of loss, damage, or theft of the hired equipment while under the Client's care, the Client will be responsible for reimbursing the contractor for the repair or replacement cost of the equipment.
If the Client wishes to cancel the Services after the equipment has been reserved or rented on their behalf, the contractor retains the right to invoice the Client for all costs incurred in securing or reserving the equipment.
The contractor shall not be liable for any issues or technical difficulties arising from the use of the hired equipment, except in cases where the equipment is found to be faulty upon rental.
Any additional terms and conditions specific to the hiring of equipment will be outlined in a separate equipment rental agreement, which will be provided to the Client before the rental period begins.
The terms of the equipment rental agreement will be deemed an integral part of this cancellation policy.
